Analytic code for bariatric analysis including synthetic data

BACKGROUND: Observational studies have reported strongly protective effects of bariatric surgery on cardiovascular disease, but with oversimplified definitions of the intervention, eligibility criteria, and follow-up, which deviate from the design a randomized trial would follow. We describe how to study the effect of bariatric surgery on cardiovascular disease without introducing these biases, which may not be entirely possible with existing observational data.

METHODS: We propose two target trials among persons with diabetes: 1) bariatric operation (vs. no operation) among individuals who have undergone pre-operative preparation (lifestyle modifications, screening) and 2) pre-operative preparation and a bariatric operation (vs. neither pre-operative nor operative component). 

RESULTS: We emulated both target trials using observational data of U.S. veterans. Comparing bariatric surgery vs. no surgery (target trial #1; 8,087 individuals), the 7-year cardiovascular risk was 18.0% (95% CI, 6.9 to 32.7) in the surgery group and 18.9% (95% CI, 17.7 to 20.1) in the no surgery group (risk difference -0.1, 95% CI -12.0 to 14.0). Comparing pre-operative components plus surgery vs. neither (target trial #2; 10,065 individuals), the 7-year cardiovascular risk was 17.4% (95% CI, 13.6 to 22.0) in the surgery group and 18.8% (95% CI, 17.8 to 19.9) in the no surgery group (risk difference -1.4, 95% CI -5.1 to 3.2). Body mass index and hemoglobin A1c were reduced with bariatric interventions in both emulations.

CONCLUSIONS: Within limitations of available observational data, our estimates do not provide evidence that bariatric surgery reduces cardiovascular disease and support equipoise for a randomized trial of bariatric surgery for cardiovascular disease prevention.
